These are just source codes of the given assignments in week 2 of duke java course on coursera:)


Hey all!
Just a small reminder
if you are the one who are directly trying to see the source code , without giving a try is not a good practice!!
First of all try it yourself, and enjoy the process of coding and writing methods...
